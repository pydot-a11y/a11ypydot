üß© Spike Findings ‚Äì Slow Translation for C4 DSL ‚Üí PNG

Summary

After digging into the latency issue during C4 DSL ‚Üí PNG translation, I‚Äôve confirmed that the slowdown comes from how the translation and image generation currently run ‚Äî fully synchronous and CPU-heavy. The biggest lag happens when users upload or modify DSLs, since every request kicks off a full re-parse and sequential rendering of all diagram views defined in the file.

Swagger examples appear fast only because they‚Äôre lightweight ‚Äúhello world‚Äù DSLs with very little content to process.

Since each translation request is unique, caching won‚Äôt help much. We also need to generate all views at once and keep the response synchronous. So instead of re-architecting it to be async, the goal here is to make the existing synchronous flow faster, more efficient, and less memory-hungry.

‚∏ª

Root Cause Analysis

1. Sequential, Single-Threaded Rendering
The main bottleneck is inside convertC4WorkspaceToC4ImageByteStream. It loops through all six view types (System Context, Container, Component, Deployment, Landscape, and Dynamic) and renders them one after the other. The total request time ends up being the sum of all those render durations, which doesn‚Äôt scale as diagrams increase.

2. High Memory Consumption
All rendered PNGs are currently stored in memory before being combined into one large byte[] for the ZIP. This doubles the memory footprint and puts unnecessary pressure on the Garbage Collector, causing slower responses and increasing the risk of OutOfMemoryError with larger DSLs.

3. Possible Renderer Re-initialization
There‚Äôs a strong chance the rendering engine (e.g., PlantUML or Structurizr exporter) is being re-instantiated per request ‚Äî or even per diagram ‚Äî which adds repeated setup and teardown overhead.

‚∏ª

Conclusion

The translation slowness comes down to a CPU-bound, sequential rendering pipeline coupled with inefficient memory handling.
The best way forward is to keep the flow synchronous but make it smarter ‚Äî by parallelizing rendering tasks and switching to a more memory-friendly streaming model.

‚∏ª

Proposed Implementation Plan

Here‚Äôs the plan, ordered by impact and ease of implementation:

‚∏ª

1. Parallelize View Rendering (Highest Impact)

Action:
Refactor the diagram rendering loop to process all views concurrently.
We can use Java‚Äôs parallelStream() or an ExecutorService to distribute rendering work across available CPU cores.

// Collect all views first
List<View> allViews = ...;

// Render in parallel
List<BytesForZip> renderedDiagrams = allViews.parallelStream()
    .map(view -> renderSingleDiagram(view, ...))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

Expected Outcome:
This should significantly reduce total request time since the process will now complete as soon as the slowest single diagram finishes, instead of summing all render times.
Estimated improvement: 2‚Äì4√ó faster on typical multi-core servers.

‚∏ª

2. Adopt a Two-Pass Streaming Model for ZIP Output

Action:
To reduce peak memory usage while keeping reliability intact, we can use a two-pass flow:
	1.	Render phase: Generate all diagrams in parallel and store their byte arrays temporarily in memory.
	2.	Stream phase: If everything renders successfully, use StreamingResponseBody to stream the ZIP directly to the response output.

This approach prevents us from building one huge final byte[] while ensuring we never send a broken ZIP if something fails mid-way.

Benefit:
Dramatically lowers memory use and prevents OutOfMemoryError, while keeping the process synchronous and safe.

‚∏ª

3. Ensure Renderer Reuse (Low-Hanging Fruit)

Action:
Confirm the rendering service (PlantUML / Structurizr) is defined as a singleton in the Spring context.
This ensures the engine is reused between requests rather than reinitialized each time.

Benefit:
Avoids repeated setup cost, especially for large diagrams or frequent requests.

‚∏ª

Next Steps
	1.	Baseline Measurement:
Add timing logs (StopWatch or similar) around parsing, rendering, and zipping to capture current performance numbers.
	2.	Implement Changes:
Apply the three improvements above ‚Äî starting with parallel rendering, followed by streaming ZIP output and renderer reuse.
	3.	Verify Performance:
Re-test with DSLs of varying complexity to measure actual gains in latency and memory usage.



Good ‚Äî since you‚Äôve already documented the spike and chosen to implement only the parallel rendering refactor this sprint, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd structure your implementation work for clarity and focus:

üéØ Implementation Plan: ‚ÄúParallelize Diagram Rendering‚Äù

You only need one Jira story for this sprint ‚Äî keep it tightly scoped around introducing parallel processing for diagram rendering.

Ticket 1:

Title: Refactor diagram rendering loop to process all views concurrently

Type: Story (Implementation)
Story Points: 3 points ‚Äî medium effort

Reasoning: The work involves safe refactoring and testing parallel streams, not a full redesign. It‚Äôs mostly contained within the rendering service layer and won‚Äôt break external APIs, but still needs careful testing to ensure thread safety and consistent output.

Ticket Description (for Jira)

Summary:
Implement parallel rendering of C4 diagrams within the convertC4WorkspaceToC4ImageByteStream flow to reduce total translation time. This involves refactoring the sequential rendering logic to utilize Java‚Äôs parallel streams (or ExecutorService) for concurrent processing of all view types.

Acceptance Criteria:
	‚Ä¢	All diagram views (System Context, Container, Component, Deployment, Landscape, Dynamic) are rendered concurrently.
	‚Ä¢	Translation time decreases significantly compared to baseline sequential version.
	‚Ä¢	Output remains deterministic ‚Äî same ZIP structure, file naming, and content integrity.
	‚Ä¢	No race conditions, corrupted images, or missing diagrams in concurrent executions.
	‚Ä¢	Unit and integration tests pass successfully.

Definition of Done:
	‚Ä¢	Refactored method merged to develop branch.
	‚Ä¢	Logs capture individual render durations for observability.
	‚Ä¢	Verified translation performance improvement on sample DSLs (small, medium, large).
	‚Ä¢	Updated test coverage and documentation for the translation flow.

‚∏ª

üß© Optional Follow-Up Tickets (For Later Sprints)

Once this story is done and validated, you can create additional tickets (after team review):
	1.	Implement Two-Pass Streaming Model for ZIP Output ‚Äì 5 points (larger refactor, memory optimization)
	2.	Ensure Renderer Reuse ‚Äì 1 point (small config-level fix)

‚∏ª

Final Sprint Setup Recommendation:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Keep 1 story (3 points) in this sprint for the parallel rendering refactor.
	‚Ä¢	üïê Hold the streaming and renderer reuse changes for the next sprint after internal discussion.

Sure ‚Äî here‚Äôs an expanded version that stays simple but gives enough clarity for a developer to start exploring right away:

üß† How I Understand the Ticket

This spike is about figuring out how to bridge the gap between C4 DSL models (which describe architecture in diagrams) and the actual source code (where the implementation lives). Currently, the C4 models are often created manually and can easily drift away from what‚Äôs in the code. The goal is to research and experiment with ways to automate or semi-automate that link, so that when developers update code, the C4 model can also reflect those changes‚Äîor vice versa.

‚∏ª

üí° Simplified Explanation for the Developer

The goal of this spike is to explore how we can build a small pipeline or tool that connects C4 DSL diagrams with the project‚Äôs source code.
You‚Äôll investigate how elements defined in the C4 DSL (like Systems, Containers, Components) can map to real code artifacts such as packages, modules, or classes. For example, if the DSL defines a ‚ÄúUserService‚Äù container, can the tool identify the corresponding UserService class or module in code and keep them in sync?

You should also look into:
	‚Ä¢	How the DSL and code can communicate (e.g., through annotations, metadata, JSON mapping, or CI/CD hooks).
	‚Ä¢	Whether we can generate or update C4 DSL files automatically based on the code structure.
	‚Ä¢	What existing tools (like Structurizr, CALM, or custom parsers) can help.

The output of this spike should be a short summary or prototype showing what‚Äôs possible, what tools/libraries might be needed, and recommended next steps for implementation.
