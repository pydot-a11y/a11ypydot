Got it — spreadsheet format, concise but professional, with columns clearly populated, and also acknowledging the new platform suggestion + potential pause.

Here is a clean copy-paste-ready row for the spreadsheet, followed by a polished Slack-style summary for the manager.

📄 Spreadsheet Entry (Your Row)

Active Workstream / Project	Status	Driving	Supporting	Q4 Forecasted Deliverable	Major Work Left	Notes / Risks / Blockers
EA Analytics — Usage Insights Expansion (Region/Dept Metadata)	In Progress	Frontend metadata integration + region/department filtering enablement	Backend endpoint alignment only where needed	Feature ready for dashboard consumption — enabling location/department segmentation of users	Complete metadata retrieval of all users beyond logged-in user; integrate dropdown + filtering logic	Possible adoption pause pending evaluation of Tech Metrics Data Lake CSV platform alternative; may pivot to new solution if approved

Slack/Manager Summary (Professional + Simple)

Dorothy — Active Workstream Update
	•	Driving EA Analytics metadata enhancement (adding department/region breakdown, UI filtering & dropdown population).
	•	Supporting backend only where minimal API alignment is needed.
	•	Expected Q4 output: fully segmented analytics view with user location + department insights.
	•	⚠ Note: Work may shift depending on decision to migrate to the Tech Metrics Data Lake alternative platform proposed by wider fleet.

If you’d like, I can generate:

🔹 a short version for the spreadsheet view
🔹 an expanded version explaining work done vs work remaining
🔹 a color-coded version (green/yellow/red status)

Which one do you want for the final sheet version?


You asked the right question — how you frame the work matters, especially since this feeds into funding, visibility, and leadership perception. Right now, the short spreadsheet entry is accurate, but it under-communicates impact, ownership, and strategic value. It reads as:

“I’m working on a feature.”

But your real story is:

You identified a gap → proposed and built the analytics platform → it drives adoption insights → now extending capability to make it more powerful → and you’re also coordinating direction.

That is strategic ownership, not task execution.

How to make your entry sound strong, outcome-oriented & leadership-level

Instead of sounding like a task, shift to:

✔ impact
✔ business value
✔ vision/roadmap
✔ leadership involvement

⸻

🔥 Strong Version (recommended for spreadsheet)

Workstream	Driving	Supporting	Q4 Outcome	Notes
EA Analytics Platform (Usage Insights + Metadata Expansion)	
End-to-end owner of analytics platform vision + front-end delivery	
Stakeholder alignment + backend coordination	
Broader adoption analytics (usage + region + department) to inform product investment decisions	
Evaluating Data Lake alternative for scale & cost-efficiency; decision pending


⸻

Why this reads as leadership & impact instead of activity

Average wording	Strong wording
“Frontend integration…”	“End-to-end owner, vision, delivery…”
“Enable filtering…”	“Deliver improved decision-making insights…”
“May pivot…”	“Evaluating strategic alternative for scale…”

One feels like execution.
The other feels like ownership + thinking ahead.

Quick Slack version (if you want short but strong)

Driving: EA Analytics (usage + metadata expansion) — owning roadmap + delivery.
Impact: Unlock visibility across user regions/departments to guide product adoption decisions.
Next: Assessing Data Lake platform as scalable alternative.

EA Analytics Platform (Usage Insights + Metadata Expansion)


Leading feature enhancement to enable region and department-based usage insights within the analytics dashboard

Backend support provided only where new data attributes need to be made available to the UI.



Deliver analytics capability to segment platform usage by user location and department for decision-making


Retrieve and map metadata for all users (not only active session user). Populate dropdown and implement front-end-based filtering.


Potential pause under consideration while evaluating the Tech Metrics Data Lake solution as an alternative ingestion and reporting approach. If shift is approved, future work may transition to that platform. Introduced during Engineering DARP – 26 Nov 2025 (Will Frece).
