1. Spreadsheet naming

Create a third sheet titled:

🔹 Workstream Ownership & Active Tasks — Q4 2025

Inside the sheet, use these column headers:

Team Member	Active Workstream(s)	What They Are Driving	Supporting On	Status (Active / Paused / TBD)	Notes / Blockers


This directly answers your manager’s request and becomes a single-source-of-truth you can update weekly.

2. Short message to send to teammates

You can copy-paste this in Slack/Teams:

⸻

Hi team! 👋
We’re updating the Workstream Ownership & Active Tasks sheet requested by Nat.
Please share the details below so we can populate your section accurately:
	1.	What you’re currently working on
	2.	What you actively own / drive
	3.	Any work you are supporting (not driving)
	4.	If nothing is active, indicate TBD

Please reply in 2–3 bullet points — quick and high-level is fine.
Sending this in so we have full clarity across the team. 💪🏾

⸻

3. Optional follow-up framing if you want to sound more structured

If people delay replying:

Just a reminder team — please drop your items in today so we can finalize the spreadsheet for Nat and ensure visibility across ongoing workstreams. Thanks 🙌
