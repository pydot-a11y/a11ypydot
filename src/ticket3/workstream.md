Got it — spreadsheet format, concise but professional, with columns clearly populated, and also acknowledging the new platform suggestion + potential pause.

Here is a clean copy-paste-ready row for the spreadsheet, followed by a polished Slack-style summary for the manager.

Slack/Manager Summary (Professional + Simple)

Dorothy — Active Workstream Update
	•	Driving EA Analytics metadata enhancement (adding department/region breakdown, UI filtering & dropdown population).
	•	Supporting backend only where minimal API alignment is needed.
	•	Expected Q4 output: fully segmented analytics view with user location + department insights.

If you’d like, I can generate:

🔹 a short version for the spreadsheet view
🔹 an expanded version explaining work done vs work remaining
🔹 a color-coded version (green/yellow/red status)

Which one do you want for the final sheet version?
