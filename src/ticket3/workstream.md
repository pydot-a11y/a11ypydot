1. Spreadsheet naming

Create a third sheet titled:

🔹 Workstream Ownership & Active Tasks — Q4 2025

Inside the sheet, use these column headers:

Team Member	Active Workstream(s)	What They Are Driving	Supporting On	Status (Active / Paused / TBD)	Notes / Blockers


This directly answers your manager’s request and becomes a single-source-of-truth you can update weekly.

2. Short message to send to teammates

You can copy-paste this in Slack/Teams:

⸻

Hi team! 👋
We’re updating the Workstream Ownership & Active Tasks sheet requested by Nat.
Please share the details below so we can populate your section accurately:
	1.	What you’re currently working on
	2.	What you actively own / drive
	3.	Any work you are supporting (not driving)
	4.	If nothing is active, indicate TBD

Please reply in 2–3 bullet points — quick and high-level is fine.
Sending this in so we have full clarity across the team. 💪🏾

⸻

3. Optional follow-up framing if you want to sound more structured

If people delay replying:

Just a reminder team — please drop your items in today so we can finalize the spreadsheet for Nat and ensure visibility across ongoing workstreams. Thanks 🙌
Here’s a clean, fast way to execute this.

If you’d like, I can generate a filled example based on your actual team roles so you only plug in names.

Share what you’re currently working on and clearly indicate which ones you drive vs where you’re only supporting.
