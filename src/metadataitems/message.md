Here’s a clear, respectful version that fits that context:

Hi [Name],

As the AB-Tooling team prepares for our planning session early next week, we wanted to reach out and ask if there’s anything on your side that you’d love us to support this year.

Since you sit at the strategy level, we’d really value insight into any current pain points, high-level components, or gaps where tooling could better support the bigger architecture vision — for example, areas where mapping strategy to tools could make your work easier.

If helpful, we’re happy to jump on a short call at your convenience, or you can simply share any thoughts by message. We have capacity and would love to align our priorities with what matters most to you.

Thanks so much,
Dorothy
