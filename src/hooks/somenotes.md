Okay, we've laid a very solid groundwork with the backend, API service layer, and React Query hooks!

**The next critical set of items to work on is integrating these hooks into your actual page components to display dynamic data, replacing the hardcoded values and placeholders.**

Here's the prioritized list:

1.  **Connect Filters from `PageHeader.tsx` to Page Components:**
    *   **Problem:** Your `PageHeader.tsx` (rendered by `Layout.tsx`) has filter dropdowns. The state for these filters (`timeframe`, `department`, `region`) currently lives within `PageHeader.tsx`.
    *   **Need:** The individual page components (`Overview.tsx`, `StructurizrAnalytics.tsx`, `C4TSAnalytics.tsx`) need access to these filter values to pass them to their respective React Query hooks (so data refetches when filters change).
    *   **Solutions (choose one or combine):**
        *   **Lift State Up:** Move the filter state (`timeframe`, `department`, `region` and their setters) from `PageHeader.tsx` up into `Layout.tsx`. Then, `Layout.tsx` can pass these filter values (and setters, if `PageHeader` still needs to update them) down to both `PageHeader.tsx` (for display/control) and to its `children` (the page components).
        *   **Context API:** Create a `FilterContext` that `Layout.tsx` provides. `PageHeader.tsx` would update this context, and page components would consume it to get the current filter values. This is cleaner for deeper nesting.
        *   **State Management Library (Zustand, Redux, etc.):** If your app grows, a dedicated state manager might be useful, but for just these filters, Context or lifting state might be sufficient.
    *   **Action:** We need to decide on an approach and implement it so that when `Overview.tsx` (for example) renders, it knows the current filter settings.

2.  **Integrate Hooks into `Overview.tsx`:**
    *   Import the necessary hooks from `src/hooks/overviewQueries.ts`:
        *   `useGetOverviewStats`
        *   `useGetOverviewC4TSChartData`
        *   `useGetOverviewStructurizrChartData`
        *   `useGetOverviewTopUsersTable`
    *   Call these hooks, passing the current filter values (obtained from Step 1).
    *   Implement `isLoading` and `isError` states for each data fetch.
    *   Replace the hardcoded `statsItems` in `Overview.tsx` with the data from `useGetOverviewStats`.
    *   Pass data from `useGetOverviewC4TSChartData` to your C4TS chart component placeholder.
    *   Pass data from `useGetOverviewStructurizrChartData` to your Structurizr chart component placeholder.
    *   Populate the "Top Users Across All Systems" table with data from `useGetOverviewTopUsersTable`.

3.  **Integrate Hooks into `StructurizrAnalytics.tsx`:**
    *   Similar to `Overview.tsx`, import and use hooks from `src/hooks/structurizrQueries.ts`:
        *   `useGetStructurizrPageStats`
        *   `useGetStructurizrWorkspaceCreationChartData` (for the main chart)
        *   `useGetStructurizrAccessMethodsData` (for the "How workspaces are being accessed" table/chart)
        *   `useGetStructurizrTopUsersChartData` (for the "TOP USERS" bar chart)
        *   Optionally `useGetRawStructurizrWorkspaces` if you need to display a raw list or use that specific nested data for something.
    *   Handle loading/error states.
    *   Connect data to the `StatsCard`, `WorkspaceChart` (you'll need to ensure your `WorkspaceChart.tsx` component can accept the `StructurizrActivityChartDataPoint[]` format from the hook), and table placeholders.
    *   Pass filter values from Step 1 to the hooks.

4.  **Integrate Hooks into `C4TSAnalytics.tsx`:**
    *   Import and use hooks from `src/hooks/c4tsQueries.ts`:
        *   `useGetC4TSPageStats`
        *   `useGetC4TSApiHitsChartData` (for the main API Hits line chart)
        *   `useGetC4TSTopUsersChartData` (for the "TOP USERS" bar chart)
        *   `useGetC4TSApiHitsUrlTable` (for the "API Hits (URL)" table)
    *   Handle loading/error states.
    *   Connect data to the relevant UI sections.
    *   Pass filter values from Step 1 to the hooks.

5.  **Implement Actual Chart Components:**
    *   Currently, many chart sections are placeholders (e.g., `<div>Chart: API hits over time</div>`).
    *   You'll need to use a charting library (like Recharts, which you already have in `WorkspaceChart.tsx`, or Chart.js, Nivo, etc.) to render the actual visualizations based on the data fetched by the hooks.
    *   Ensure the chart components are flexible enough to accept the data formats provided by your hooks (e.g., `ChartDataPointDateCount[]`, `StructurizrActivityChartDataPoint[]`, `UserActivityChartDataPoint[]`).

6.  **Refine Backend Database Queries:**
    *   Once the frontend is consuming data, you'll likely identify areas where the mock backend data or initial DB queries need refinement (e.g., more complex aggregations for charts, specific sorting, filtering based on parameters sent from the frontend).
    *   Iterate on the MongoDB queries in `server/src/index.ts` to provide the exact data needed.

**Let's start with Item 1: Connecting Filters.**

Could you please share the code for your `Layout.tsx` and `PageHeader.tsx` components? This will help us decide the best way to manage and propagate the filter state.
