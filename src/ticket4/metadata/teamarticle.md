Celebrating Excellence: The Enterprise Architecture Team Sets the Benchmark at Turntabl

At Turntabl, engineering excellence is not just about writing great code — it’s about ownership, leadership, collaboration, and impact. This year’s Internal Awards highlighted that distinction clearly, and one team stood out unmistakably among the rest: the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Team.

Out of nearly 20 engineering teams across Turntabl, working on diverse projects for multiple clients — with teams ranging from 2 to 6 engineers — the Enterprise Architecture team emerged as Best Technical Team, the only team recommended by multiple Engineering Managers and Team Leads. This recognition speaks not just to technical strength, but to consistency, trust, and world-class delivery.

Best Technical Team: Raising the Bar

The Best Technical Team award recognizes more than output — it celebrates teams that combine technical depth with discipline, innovation, and leadership.

Across multiple nominations, a clear and consistent picture emerged. The Enterprise Architecture team was described as:
	•	A group that takes full ownership of its work
	•	Engineers who drive projects forward with discipline and clarity
	•	A team that continuously innovates, from advanced engineering initiatives to exploring emerging technologies
	•	Professionals whose reputation extends beyond Turntabl, earning strong trust and recognition from client teams

A standout achievement repeatedly highlighted was the team’s work on the FINOS CALM initiative, including the successful release of CALM version 1.0 — a milestone recognized across the global open-source community. The impact of this work went beyond delivery: members of the team were invited to London to present at the FINOS Conference, where they represented both Turntabl and Morgan Stanley with distinction.

Just as important as the technical output was how the work was done. Nominators consistently emphasized two things:
	1.	The strength of the team — driven, curious, and committed engineers pushing themselves to improve.
	2.	Exceptional leadership — steady, focused, and intentional, fostering a culture of ownership, high standards, and reliable delivery.

Together, this has positioned the Enterprise Architecture team as the benchmark for what a Turntabl engineering team can and should be.

Individual Excellence Within a World-Class Team

What makes this achievement even more powerful is that excellence didn’t stop at the team level.

🏆 Most Volunteering Award — Dorothy Ewuah
The Most Volunteering Award recognizes extraordinary commitment to service, knowledge sharing, and community impact — both within Turntabl and beyond.

Dorothy Ewuah’s contributions this year were exceptional in both scope and impact. From teaching, mentoring, and leading initiatives, to representing Turntabl at major industry events and contributing to large-scale community projects, she consistently stepped forward with purpose and passion.

Her work has:
	•	Strengthened Turntabl’s external visibility
	•	Expanded professional networks and partnerships
	•	Inspired colleagues across teams to engage, give back, and lead

More than the number of engagements, what stood out to nominators was her initiative, leadership, and genuine commitment to uplifting others — making her an outstanding ambassador for Turntabl.

🏆 Go-To Person (Engineering) — Joseph Brown-Pobee
Voted for directly by peers, the Go-To Person award is one of the strongest endorsements a colleague can receive.

Joseph Brown-Pobee was recognized as the engineer everyone relies on — always ready with answers, support, and a helping hand. His calm problem-solving approach, depth of knowledge, and willingness to help make complex challenges feel manageable.

That this award was people-nominated and people-voted is a testament to the depth of his influence and the respect he commands across the engineering organization.

A Team That Represents the Best of Turntabl

Together, these awards tell a powerful story.

The Enterprise Architecture team is not just technically strong — it is trusted, admired, and impactful. It delivers at a world-class level, represents Turntabl with excellence on global stages, and fosters individuals who lead, serve, and support others.

In every sense, this is a team that exemplifies the might and mettle of Turntabl engineering — and sets the standard for what excellence looks like.

Congratulations to the Enterprise Architecture team, to Dorothy Ewuah, and to Joseph Brown-Pobee. This recognition is well-earned — and well-deserved.


Good catch — you’re right. Here’s a clean, accurate rewrite that makes it clear he was nominated, not a winner, while still honoring his impact.

People’s Choice Nominee – Most Hilarious — Elisha Amenuveve
Excellence in a team is also reflected in its culture, and Elisha Amenuveve’s People’s Choice nomination for Most Hilarious speaks to the energy he brings to the Enterprise Architecture team. Frequently recognized by colleagues for his humor and light-hearted presence, Elisha plays an important role in keeping the team grounded, connected, and resilient — especially during high-pressure moments. His nomination highlights the strong interpersonal culture within the team, where collaboration, morale, and mutual respect are just as valued as technical delivery.

This keeps it factual, respectful, and blends smoothly with the rest of the article.
