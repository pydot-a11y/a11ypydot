Good call on separate tabs — that already makes it feel more intentional and less “template-ish”.

Below is a more natural, professional wording you can paste into each OneNote tab, plus how to handle simultaneous edits safely.

⸻

🔹 General note (top of each tab)

Please add short bullet points. One thought per line. Focus on observations and experiences rather than individuals.

That’s it. No over-instruction.

⸻

🧱 Tab 1: What We Built

Focus: delivery and outcomes

Add a short line under the heading:

A look back at what we delivered, improved, and enabled over the year.

Suggested prompts (don’t label them as prompts — just subtle cues):
	•	Key features, systems, or capabilities delivered
	•	Technical or architectural improvements
	•	Process or tooling changes that stuck
	•	Areas where we created clear impact

⸻

🧠 Tab 2: What We Learned

Focus: patterns and insight

Intro line:

Reflections on what worked well, what didn’t, and the patterns that shaped our year.

Natural sections:
	•	Things that consistently helped us move faster
	•	Friction points or recurring challenges
	•	Technical lessons or trade-offs
	•	Collaboration and ways of working
	•	Anything that surprised us

⸻

🚀 Tab 3: What’s Next

Focus: direction, not a backlog

Intro line:

Thoughts on how we want to work and what we want to prioritize going into 2026.

Sections that feel mature and intentional:
	•	What we should continue doing
	•	What needs improvement or more focus
	•	What we should simplify or stop
	•	Areas that deserve intentional investment next year

⸻

⭐ (Optional) Tab 4: Themes & Takeaways

You (or facilitators) own this tab.

Intro line:

Key themes and takeaways emerging from the discussion.

This becomes your output artifact.

⸻

✍🏽 How people edit at the same time (without overwriting)

OneNote handles this better than most tools:
	•	Each person edits in their own note container
	•	OneNote auto-syncs and merges changes
	•	You’ll see initials or cursors when others are typing
	•	Conflicts are rare unless two people edit the same bullet at the same time

Simple etiquette to avoid clashes
	•	Add new bullets, don’t edit someone else’s text
	•	If you agree, add a 👍 or add a new bullet instead
	•	Don’t rewrite headings during the session

That’s enough — no need to explain this verbally unless asked.

⸻

Why this will feel natural (not “generated”)
	•	Minimal instructional language
	•	No buzzwords
	•	Calm, reflective tone
	•	Clear separation of thinking phases
	•	Leaves room for engineers to think, not perform

If you want, I can also:
	•	Write a 30-second opening script
	•	Help you close with a strong verbal summary
	•	Help you turn the takeaways into a follow-up note or planning input


    Implement TAI client query for user department metadata lookup
    Add user metadata API endpoint for department filtering
    Add tests for user metadata endpoint

    Add user metadata API to support department-based analytics filtering

    Metadata is returned as a single keyed object to allow efficient lookup and reuse on the frontend
	•	Backend performs a single batched TAI request per call to avoid per-user API calls
