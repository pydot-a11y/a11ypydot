That's an excellent question. Breaking down a single, large feature request like "toggle data by environment" into well-defined, estimable Jira tickets is a critical skill for any development team. It provides clarity, allows for parallel work, and makes progress measurable.

Here is a professional breakdown of how you can split that one Jira ticket into multiple, logical stories, complete with user-centric titles, clear acceptance criteria, and common story point estimates.

**Story Pointing Philosophy Used Here:**
*   **1 point:** Trivial change, very little risk (e.g., a text change).
*   **2 points:** Small, straightforward task with clear requirements.
*   **3 points:** Medium complexity, involves some logic or refactoring but the path is clear.
*   **5 points:** High complexity, involves significant refactoring, asynchronous logic, or unknown variables.

### **Breakdown of Jira Tickets for "Environment Toggling" Feature**

Here are 4-5 tickets that logically divide the work.

#### **Ticket 1: Foundation - Add Environment to Global Filters**

*   **Title:** `FEAT: Add Environment Filter to Global Dashboard Controls`
*   **User Story:** "As a dashboard user, I want to see a new 'Environment' dropdown filter alongside the existing filters, so that I can later select which environment's data to view."
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Technical Tasks):**
    1.  Update `src/types/common.ts`: The `ActiveFilters` interface must be updated to include a new `environment: EnvironmentId;` property.
    2.  Update `src/constants/Filters.tsx`: Define and export `ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS` (e.g., 'All', 'DEV', 'QA', 'PROD') and a `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.
    3.  Update `src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`: Add the new `environment` to the `activeFilters` state and create a handler function (`handleEnvironmentChange`).
    4.  Update `src/components/layout/PageHeader.tsx`: Add the new "Environment" dropdown to the UI, wire it up to the state and handler from `Layout.tsx`, and adjust the grid layout to accommodate it.
*   **Story Points: 2**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a low-risk, straightforward task. It involves plumbing and state management but no complex data fetching or transformation logic.

#### **Ticket 2: Core Data Layer - Aggregate Data from All Environments**

*   **Title:** `REFACTOR: Update API service to fetch and aggregate data from multiple environments`
*   **User Story:** "As a developer, I need the data fetching layer to be able to query multiple environments (DEV, QA, PROD) in parallel, tag the returned data with its source environment, and combine it into a single dataset for the UI to consume."
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Technical Tasks):**
    1.  Modify the core fetching functions (`fetchRawC4TSLogsByDate`, `fetchRawStructurizrLogsByDate`) in `apiService.ts` to accept an `environment` string as a parameter, which is used to construct the correct API endpoint URL.
    2.  Create new "aggregator" functions (`fetchAllC4TSLogs`, `fetchAllStructurizrLogs`) that use `Promise.allSettled` to call the core fetching functions for each environment in `ENVIRONMENTS_TO_FETCH`.
    3.  Ensure that each record returned from the aggregator functions is "tagged" with a new `environment` property (e.g., `{ ..., environment: 'DEV' }`).
    4.  Update the `RawApiLog` and `RawStructurizrLog` types to include the new optional `environment?: string;` property.
*   **Story Points: 3**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is of medium complexity. It involves asynchronous logic (`Promise.all`), error handling for multiple requests, and data manipulation (tagging). It is a critical, foundational piece of the new architecture.

#### **Ticket 3: Feature Implementation - Enable Environment Toggling on Overview Page**

*   **Title:** `FEAT: Implement environment data toggling on the Overview page`
*   **User Story:** "As a dashboard user, when I select a specific environment (e.g., 'Dev') from the global dropdown, I want all stats cards, charts, and tables on the Overview page to instantly update to show data only from that environment."
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Technical Tasks):**
    1.  Refactor the `useQuery` hook in `Overview.tsx` to call the new aggregator functions (e.g., `fetchAllC4TSLogs`) instead of the single-environment fetchers. The query key should no longer include the environment filter, as we always fetch all environments.
    2.  In the `pageData = useMemo(...)` block, add a new filtering step at the very beginning to slice the master dataset based on the `activeFilters.environment` value.
    3.  Confirm that all subsequent calculations (trends, chart data, etc.) flow from this newly environment-filtered dataset.
*   **Story Points: 3**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is the first implementation of the new data flow on a page. It involves significant refactoring of the page's core data processing logic and serves as the template for other pages.

#### **Ticket 4 & 5 (Optional, can be one ticket): Roll Out to Detailed Pages**

You can create one ticket per page or a single ticket for both, depending on your team's preference.

*   **Ticket 4 Title:** `FEAT: Implement environment toggling on the C4TS Analytics page`
*   **Ticket 5 Title:** `FEAT: Implement environment toggling on the Structurizr Analytics page`
*   **User Story:** "As a dashboard user, when I select an environment, I want the C4TS/Structurizr Analytics page to update all its visuals to reflect data from only that environment."
*   **Acceptance Criteria (Technical Tasks):**
    1.  Apply the same architectural pattern from the `Overview.tsx` implementation to `C4TSAnalytics.tsx` (and `StructurizrAnalytics.tsx`).
    2.  Update the page's master `useQuery` hook to call the appropriate aggregator function (`fetchAllC4TSLogs` or `fetchAllStructurizrLogs`).
    3.  Add the environment filtering step at the top of the page's `useMemo` data derivation logic.
*   **Story Points: 2 each**
    *   **Reasoning:** These tasks are less complex than the first implementation on the Overview page because the pattern has already been established. The developer is primarily replicating a known, working solution.
