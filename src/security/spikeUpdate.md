Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs re-frame the spike as if you were writing it today with what you‚Äôve actually discovered and implemented. Here‚Äôs how each section would look now:

‚∏ª

Spike Findings
	‚Ä¢	Structurizr On-Prem (Next.js) only handled workspace creation and stored the workspace and eonid mapping.
	‚Ä¢	There was no mechanism to track modifications (when/by whom a workspace was modified).
	‚Ä¢	Explored extending the Java Structurizr Plugin to hook into the workspace save lifecycle and emit modification events.
	‚Ä¢	Two main approaches considered:
	1.	Direct DB Write from Plugin
	‚Ä¢	Plugin would update MongoDB directly.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: exposed DB credentials, tightly coupled plugin to schema, weak audit trail.
	2.	Authenticated API Call to Portal (Recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Plugin emits a workspace-modified event to the portal API.
	‚Ä¢	Portal validates/authenticates and updates Mongo.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: centralized schema changes, strong audit logging, better security.
	‚Ä¢	Auth Mechanism: Initially considered JWT/mTLS/HMAC.
	‚Ä¢	During implementation, Kerberos was adopted due to enterprise domain constraints (integration with existing MSAD infrastructure).

‚∏ª

Proposed Implementation Approach

In Structurizr Plugin (Java):
	‚Ä¢	Hook into putWorkspace(...) save lifecycle.
	‚Ä¢	Construct workspace-modified event payload:
	‚Ä¢	workspaceId, modifiedAt, modifiedBy, eventId (unique), optional eonId.
	‚Ä¢	Send event securely to Portal API (/api/events/workspace-modified) using Kerberos authentication.
	‚Ä¢	Retry logic + exponential backoff added.
	‚Ä¢	Idempotency ensured by eventId.

In Structurizr Portal (Next.js):
	‚Ä¢	Added new API routes:
	‚Ä¢	/api/events/ping ‚Üí used by plugin to verify session/auth.
	‚Ä¢	/api/events/workspace-modified ‚Üí accepts modification events.
	‚Ä¢	/api/debug/db ‚Üí debug Mongo connectivity.
	‚Ä¢	Middleware validates Kerberos session and resolves user identity.
	‚Ä¢	Events are:
	‚Ä¢	Logged into a new workspace_activity collection (audit log).
	‚Ä¢	Used to upsert lastModifiedAt and lastModifiedBy into the workspaces collection.

MongoDB Schema Updates:
	‚Ä¢	workspaces collection:
	‚Ä¢	Added lastModifiedAt (Date), lastModifiedBy (String).
	‚Ä¢	New workspace_activity collection:
	‚Ä¢	eventId (String, unique)
	‚Ä¢	workspaceId (String)
	‚Ä¢	eonId (optional String)
	‚Ä¢	modifiedAt (Date)
	‚Ä¢	modifiedBy (String)
	‚Ä¢	pluginVersion (optional String)
	‚Ä¢	receivedAt (Date)

‚∏ª

Spike Outcome
	‚Ä¢	Final approach chosen: Plugin ‚Üí Kerberos-authenticated API ‚Üí Structurizr Portal ‚Üí MongoDB.
	‚Ä¢	Verified flow:
	‚Ä¢	Plugin can emit events and portal receives them (confirmed via /ping).
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB persistence currently blocked by Kerberos write permissions, being resolved.
	‚Ä¢	Design validated and implementation path is clear ‚Äî spike objective complete.

üëâ This way, your spike ticket shows what you explored, what you chose, what changed (JWT ‚Üí Kerberos), and where you landed.

Would you like me to also draft a short ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù paragraph you can add at the bottom of the spike (something like: ‚ÄúEscalating early could have unblocked Kerberos faster‚Äù) so you frame the delay as a growth point rather than a weakness?

I‚Äôm a software engineer with over five years of experience delivering impactful, production-ready software across diverse stacks. At Morgan Stanley, I‚Äôve contributed to enterprise systems using Java Spring Boot and React, while leading engineering efforts that bridge clean architecture, great design, and solid team collaboration.

‚Ä¢ From designing seamless user flows in Figma to building APIs that power real-time systems, I enjoy taking ideas from concept to code. I‚Äôm driven by clarity, structure, and meaningful results‚Äîand I bring that into every project, sprint, and team I work with.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm especially passionate about making tech more inclusive. My current focus explores how AI can be embedded into the SDLC to improve accessibility and developer experience by design. I regularly share my work through open-source tools, internal demos, and conference presentations.

‚Ä¢ Outside of work, I serve as Chairperson for PyCon Ghana 2025 and volunteer with PyLadies Ghana, IndabaX, and other community-led movements. Whether I‚Äôm mentoring, leading, or learning something new (like French), I believe in showing up fully‚Äîand helping others do the same.


 I‚Äôm a backend-focused software engineer with over four years of experience building scalable, efficient, and high-performing systems. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and SQL/MongoDB, with a growing interest in system architecture. My long-term goal is to become a Software Architect, and I approach every project with that mindset ‚Äî balancing design, performance, and reliability.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve become the go-to person on my team for navigating domain-specific challenges within Morgan Stanley‚Äôs complex environment. Whether it‚Äôs resolving deep-rooted issues, unblocking teammates, or improving existing systems, I enjoy stepping in, finding clarity, and delivering solid solutions. My collaborative approach and strong understanding of the domain make me a key resource across multiple initiatives.

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm deeply committed to writing clean, maintainable code, and I thrive in Agile environments where I can continuously learn and grow. I bring structure, patience, and a strong sense of ownership to the teams I work with ‚Äî making sure we not only ship on time, but build systems we‚Äôre proud of.

‚Ä¢ Outside of work, I‚Äôm passionate about staying current with architecture trends and constantly refining my skills. I believe that great software is as much about people as it is about code ‚Äî and I strive to be a teammate others can count on.
