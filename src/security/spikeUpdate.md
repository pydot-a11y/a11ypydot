Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs re-frame the spike as if you were writing it today with what you‚Äôve actually discovered and implemented. Here‚Äôs how each section would look now:

‚∏ª

Spike Findings
	‚Ä¢	Structurizr On-Prem (Next.js) only handled workspace creation and stored the workspace and eonid mapping.
	‚Ä¢	There was no mechanism to track modifications (when/by whom a workspace was modified).
	‚Ä¢	Explored extending the Java Structurizr Plugin to hook into the workspace save lifecycle and emit modification events.
	‚Ä¢	Two main approaches considered:
	1.	Direct DB Write from Plugin
	‚Ä¢	Plugin would update MongoDB directly.
	‚Ä¢	Cons: exposed DB credentials, tightly coupled plugin to schema, weak audit trail.
	2.	Authenticated API Call to Portal (Recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Plugin emits a workspace-modified event to the portal API.
	‚Ä¢	Portal validates/authenticates and updates Mongo.
	‚Ä¢	Pros: centralized schema changes, strong audit logging, better security.
	‚Ä¢	Auth Mechanism: Initially considered JWT/mTLS/HMAC.
	‚Ä¢	During implementation, Kerberos was adopted due to enterprise domain constraints (integration with existing MSAD infrastructure).

Proposed Implementation Approach

In Structurizr Plugin (Java):
	‚Ä¢	Hook into putWorkspace(...) save lifecycle.
	‚Ä¢	Construct workspace-modified event payload:
	‚Ä¢	workspaceId, modifiedAt, modifiedBy, eventId (unique), optional eonId.
	‚Ä¢	Send event securely to Portal API (/api/events/workspace-modified) using Kerberos authentication.
	‚Ä¢	Retry logic + exponential backoff added.
	‚Ä¢	Idempotency ensured by eventId.

In Structurizr Portal (Next.js):
	‚Ä¢	Added new API routes:
	‚Ä¢	/api/events/ping ‚Üí used by plugin to verify session/auth.
	‚Ä¢	/api/events/workspace-modified ‚Üí accepts modification events.
	‚Ä¢	/api/debug/db ‚Üí debug Mongo connectivity.
	‚Ä¢	Middleware validates Kerberos session and resolves user identity.
	‚Ä¢	Events are:
	‚Ä¢	Logged into a new workspace_activity collection (audit log).
	‚Ä¢	Used to upsert lastModifiedAt and lastModifiedBy into the workspaces collection.

MongoDB Schema Updates:
	‚Ä¢	workspaces collection:
	‚Ä¢	Added lastModifiedAt (Date), lastModifiedBy (String).
	‚Ä¢	New workspace_activity collection:
	‚Ä¢	eventId (String, unique)
	‚Ä¢	workspaceId (String)
	‚Ä¢	eonId (optional String)
	‚Ä¢	modifiedAt (Date)
	‚Ä¢	modifiedBy (String)
	‚Ä¢	pluginVersion (optional String)
	‚Ä¢	receivedAt (Date)

Spike Outcome
	‚Ä¢	Final approach chosen: Plugin ‚Üí Kerberos-authenticated API ‚Üí Structurizr Portal ‚Üí MongoDB.
	‚Ä¢	Verified flow:
	‚Ä¢	Plugin can emit events and portal receives them (confirmed via /ping).
	‚Ä¢	MongoDB persistence currently blocked by Kerberos write permissions, being resolved.
	‚Ä¢	Design validated and implementation path is clear ‚Äî spike objective complete.

üëâ This way, your spike ticket shows what you explored, what you chose, what changed (JWT ‚Üí Kerberos), and where you landed.

Would you like me to also draft a short ‚Äúlessons learned‚Äù paragraph you can add at the bottom of the spike (something like: ‚ÄúEscalating early could have unblocked Kerberos faster‚Äù) so you frame the delay as a growth point rather than a weakness?
