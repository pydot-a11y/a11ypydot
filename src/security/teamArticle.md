Enterprise Architecture Tooling: Translating, Automating, and Elevating Architecture Practices

Overview

The Enterprise Architecture team is committed to building solutions that simplify, standardize, and accelerate architecture practices across the firm. At the center of this effort is C4TS (C4 Translation Service), an internally developed platform that enables seamless translation and visualization of architectural models. Surrounding C4TS, the team has expanded into CALM (Common Architecture Language Model) integration, Policy as Code (PaC), and a new wave of GenAI-powered automation under the Ai-rchitect platform. Together, these initiatives reduce manual work, enhance compliance, and empower architects and developers to focus on designing resilient, future-ready systems.

C4TS – The Core Platform

C4TS is the flagship of the portfolio. It addresses one of the hardest challenges in enterprise architecture: ensuring that models remain usable and accurate across diverse tools and frameworks.
	•	iDesigner Integration: Enables bidirectional translation between iDesigner proprietary JSON and C4 JSON/DSL. This reduces duplication and accelerates security reviews, case creation, and artifact management.
	•	Format Translation Service: Automates translation across formats such as C4 DSL, Mermaid, PlantUML, Breeze, PNG, and SVG, improving interoperability across platforms.
	•	Image Translation Service: Produces rich, up-to-date architecture diagrams (PNG, SVG) that plug directly into pipelines and application code, keeping visuals synchronized with source models.
	•	Developer Libraries: To make adoption easier, the team built Java and Python client libraries, enabling engineers to integrate C4TS directly into their codebases and development workflows.
	•	Analytics Platform: Beyond translation, the team developed an analytics layer that monitors usage of both C4TS and Structurizr services. This provides insights into adoption, highlights growth trends, and guides ongoing product improvements.

By automating translation, reducing complexity, and embedding usage insights, C4TS accelerates documentation cycles while ensuring fidelity across multiple representations.

CALM (Common Architecture Language Model)

As part of the FINOS open-source initiative, CALM provides a structured JSON schema for describing architectures. ETS plays a key role in enabling CALM adoption across the firm.

Through C4TS integration, architects can transform C4 models into CALM-compliant structures, embedding policy-driven rules and patterns into architecture. This ensures designs are consistent, compliant, and reusable across teams.

Why CALM matters:
	•	Standardized architecture descriptions in a machine-readable format.
	•	Automated validation and compliance checks in pipelines.
	•	Reduction in manual modeling effort through governance automation.

Policy as Code (PaC)

Policy as Code extends automation into governance and compliance. Instead of relying on static documentation, PaC translates policies, controls, and evidence into structured, testable definitions.

Business benefits include:
	•	Greater consistency and accuracy of controls.
	•	Automated compliance and drift detection between approval vs. implementation.
	•	Faster validation cycles and improved auditability.

When combined with CALM, PaC enables metadata mapping from firm documents into CALM schemas, visualizing the chain of policies → controls → evidence within architecture models.

Ai-rchitect: GenAI-Powered Enhancements

Beyond translation and compliance, the Enterprise Architecture team is advancing automation with Ai-rchitect, a GenAI platform designed to enhance architecture practices. Two major initiatives now live under this umbrella are:

Structurizr DSL Generator

Analyzes repositories and generates architecture documentation automatically in C4 DSL format.
	•	Produces starter artifacts effortlessly, even for legacy systems.
	•	Ensures a structured, industry-standard format for consistency.
	•	Integrates with Structurizr and visualization tools.
	•	Accelerates onboarding with clear documentation.
	•	Supports governance by maintaining an up-to-date system view.
	•	Identifies technical debt through visualized code structures.

C4 Reviewer

Guides teams in improving the quality and usability of C4 DSL documentation by leveraging GenAI for best practice analysis.
	•	Elevates C4 Models Beyond Visualization by treating DSL as full architectural documentation.
	•	Improves Quality by applying coding best practices and assurance techniques.
	•	Enables Reusable and Extensible Diagrams through best-practice recommendations.
	•	Unlocks Underused Features in Structurizr C4 DSL often overlooked by users.

Who it serves:
	•	New adopters learning the C4 DSL.
	•	Experienced users aiming to improve documentation quality.
	•	Architecture teams standardizing practices.
	•	Reviewers validating architectural outputs.

How it works:
	•	Curates and refines a C4 best practices library.
	•	Applies AI-powered analysis against these best practices.
	•	Provides multi-dimensional feedback (Core, Advanced, Nice-to-Have).
	•	Supports interactive discussions for clarification.
	•	Enables continuous improvement through user feedback.

Together, the DSL Generator and C4 Reviewer establish Ai-rchitect as a platform that not only automates documentation but also enhances quality and governance through intelligent recommendations.

Challenges and Contributions

The Enterprise Architecture team has consistently delivered solutions that make architecture more efficient, transparent, and compliant. From developer libraries and analytics platforms to policy-driven compliance and AI-enhanced documentation, the team has transformed how architecture is created and maintained across the firm.

This innovative work is the result of the dedication and expertise of the ETS Tooling team, whose focus on automation, interoperability, and governance ensures that enterprise architecture evolves with the demands of the business.

Would you like me to suggest a crisp one-liner tagline to sit right at the top (something like “From translation to AI-powered automation, ETS is redefining enterprise architecture tooling”) — or keep it clean and formal like the Honeycomb article?
