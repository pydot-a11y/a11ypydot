Focus Metrics (ISO 25000): Functionality, Usability, Efficiency.

Systems Engineer (Working on Structurizr Platform)

Key Need: Build a compliant, secure, reliable, and maintainable Structurizr platform/integration.

Focus Metrics (ISO 25000): Security, Maintainability, Reliability, Portability.

Internal Product Owner (for Structurizr)

Key Need: Offer the best user experience; encourage building and sharing of architectural models; deliver a platform for C4 that makes adoption easy.

Focus Metrics (similar to Systems Engineer + Usability): Security, Maintainability, Reliability, Portability, Usability.

2. Pain Points (per Persona & General)

General UI/UX & Usability:

UI is unintuitive (Product Owner, general sentiment from low usability scores).

Onboarding procedure could be better (reflected in score).

Difficulty navigating/using the tool (implied by usability concerns).

"Hello World" / Starter DSLs needed for easier entry.

Junior Software Engineer:

Struggles to get started effectively due to lack of clear architectural understanding (addressed by needing better tool support).

Senior Software Architect:

Difficulty sharing models effectively across teams.

Current modeling might not fully support complex proposed architectures easily.

Systems Engineer:

Structurizr not built with consideration for large enterprises.

Challenges with deploying Structurizr on modern architecture.

Maintaining reliability and low maintenance for the platform.

Internal Product Owner:

Structurizr UI is unintuitive.

Needs alternative solutions for teams with complex architectural models.

Making adoption of C4 via Structurizr easier.

Common Pain Points (across multiple personas or implied):

Lack of robust DSL version control.

Limited collaboration features.

Difficulty making the tool work for very complex scenarios.

Potential for issues when running Structurizr (reliability score not perfect).

3. Proposals & Solutions

A. Core Proposal: Native Git Integration
* Goal: Provide robust software version control for architecture DSL, integrate with existing developer workflows.
* Benefits:
* Store software architecture alongside code.
* Retain low barrier to entry of Structurizr.
* Facilitate collaboration and history tracking.
* Address a significant pain point (lack of version control).
* Most valuable enhancement identified in the survey.
* Implementation Details:
* Native link between Structurizr and Git.
* Completed by existing team, contributed back to open-source.
* Consider cyber security (authentication, encryption at rest & in transit for Git repos).

B. UI/UX Improvements & Ease of Use
* Goal: Make Structurizr more intuitive, user-friendly, and easier to onboard.
* Proposals:
* Redesign UI for clarity and better navigation.
* Improve onboarding (tutorials, guides).
* Provide "Starter DSLs" or "Hello World" examples.
* Spike: Improve UI (general).
* Spike: Investigate embedding custom JS (potentially for UI enhancements or custom visualizations).

C. Developer Experience Enhancements (DSL & Tooling)
* Goal: Make DSL editing and interaction more efficient and powerful.
* Proposals:
* VS Code Plugin:
* Allow users to edit DSLs in VS Code.
* Visualize DSLs within VS Code.
* Save to their Git repo from VS Code.
* Then use Structurizr UI for more detailed visualization/interaction.
* Consider IntelliSense-like features for DSL editing (discussed previously).
* Improve integration points (APIs/CLIs).

D. Collaboration
* Goal: Enable better teamwork around architectural models.
* Proposals:
* Git integration inherently supports asynchronous collaboration.
* Further explore features for direct collaboration within the tool if Git isn't sufficient (e.g., commenting, though this wasn't explicitly detailed in this round).

E. Enterprise & Platform Enhancements
* Goal: Make Structurizr more robust, scalable, and suitable for larger organizations.
* Proposals:
* Focus on reliability, maintainability, security, and portability (as per Systems Engineer & PO needs).
* Ensure the platform can handle complex architectural models.
* Improve open-source offering and encourage contributions.

4. Summary of Quantitative Feedback (Scores out of 10)

Reliability: Do you use Structurizr without issue at least 95% of the time? Average: 5.71/10 (Indicates room for improvement).

Usability (Ease of Use): How easy is it to use Structurizr? Average: 5.31/10 (Significant area for improvement).

Usability (Onboarding): How would you rate the onboarding procedure? Average: 6.36/10 (Better, but still improvable).

Preference: Do you generally prefer Structurizr to other architectural tools? Average: 7.86/10 (Strong positive signal about core value).

Recommendation Likelihood: How likely are you to recommend Structurizr? Average: 6.86/10 (Good, but could be higher with improvements).

Overall Average Score: 6.42/10

Key Takeaway from Scores: Users see the value (preference is high), but reliability and especially ease of use/onboarding are significant pain points.

5. Key Recommendations from the Internal Survey/Discussion

Top Priority: Implement native Git integration. This is seen as providing the largest value for clients.

UI/UX Improvement: Essential to address the low usability scores and unintuitive nature.

VS Code Plugin: A strong proposal to meet developers where they are and improve the DSL editing experience.

Continue Open Source Contribution: Valuable for broader adoption and community engagement.

Address Enterprise Needs: Focus on making the tool robust for larger, complex deployments.

Cybersecurity: A key consideration, especially with Git integration.

Next Steps (Based on this synthesis):

Prioritize the Git Integration: Solidify the plan, address security concerns (Horizon Scan), and allocate resources.

Tackle UI/UX & Onboarding:

Initiate the UI improvement spike.

Develop starter DSLs/templates.

Plan for improved onboarding materials.

Develop the VS Code Plugin: This seems like a high-impact developer experience win.

Iterate and Gather Feedback: As these features are developed, continuously gather feedback from your personas to ensure they meet the needs.

This structured breakdown should help in pinpointing the most critical areas and formulating a clear path forward. You have a strong foundation of user feedback to build upon!
